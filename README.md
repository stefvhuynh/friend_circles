Friend Circles
==============

This is a light Ruby on Rails clone of a Google+. Users sign up and create circles from a 
list of all existing users. Users can create posts with associated links and post to
specific circles. The members of that user's circles will be able to see his/her posts.

This was primarily an exercise in 
[polymorphic associations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations)
and the creation of records through associations.
