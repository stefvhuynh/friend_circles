== README

This is light Ruby on Rails clone of a Google+. Users sign up and create circles from a 
list of all existing users. Users can create posts with associated links and post to
specific circles. The members of that user's circles will be able to see his/her posts.

To try it out, simply run the Rails server and go to localhost:3000/user/new.
